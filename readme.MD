# Dynamic On-chain NFT

## Dynamic because
Based on the price of ETH at the time of minting, the minted NFT will differ

If eth is above $3000 -> A happy face NFT will be minted
If eth is above $3000 -> A sad face NFT will be minted

So our nft is going to change based on some real world data which makes it so much powerful and cool

# 100% on-chain NFT
The Token's URI/metadata with the image file will be stored on chain

Then the contract would obviously be really expensive to deploy with those large image files

But here we will be using the powerfull technology of SVG's that are really-really small encoded image files, making the smart contract so much less expensive to deploy on chain
